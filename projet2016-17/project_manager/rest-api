TODO AJAX
- Manage data to call good XHR between add and delete a choice
    => good way
    => darken numberChoices too (we want not this)
    => click to undo is only on td's child (we want everywhere which is not user span)
    => click to delete triggers a add event...


TODO front-end
    => sign in, sign up
